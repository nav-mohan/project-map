# project-map
using jonathan somas' sawhorse layout. except its a html file like project-copy. replace the D3 chart, with a mapboxgl.js map. The scatterplot on the map was made using a D3 svg though. Also, I'm using D3 version 5 (not version 4) for the sake of .then() functionality in D3 when importing json data.
